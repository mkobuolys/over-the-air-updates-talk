# From fear to air: embracing over-the-air app updates

![Header image](header.png)

Repeat after me: app updates are stressful. Dealing with app store reviews and worrying about disrupting users can make anyone hesitant to release new features. But what if there was a better way? Over-the-air (OTA) updates let you deliver changes directly to your users, super fast and without any fuss. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore various OTA update techniques, from simple tools to advanced methods like code push for instant fixes, feature flags for controlled rollouts and A/B testing, server-driven UI for dynamic content, and even generative AI for personalized experiences.

## Building

You can follow these instructions to build the slides and run them locally.

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Flutter, please first follow the [Flutter Setup](https://flutter.dev/setup/) guide.

### Building and running the slides

To build and run the slides, run the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:mkobuolys/over-the-air-updates-talk.git
cd over-the-air-updates-talk
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The `flutter run` command both builds and runs the Flutter app on your device, browser or emulator.

For the best experience, use the macOS build with the `--release` flag:

```
flutter run -d macos --release
```

### Running a short version of the slides

To run a short version of the slides, which is suitable for a 10-minute talk, you can pass the `USE_SHORT_VERSION` environment variable to the app. You can do this by using the `--dart-define` flag when running the app:

```
flutter run --dart-define USE_SHORT_VERSION=true
```

### Enabling generative AI features

To enable the generative AI features in the slides (using Gemini), you need to pass the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the app. You can do this by using the `--dart-define` flag when running the app:

```
flutter run --dart-define GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

You can get your API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com). Do not forget to replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key. Make sure to keep your API key secret and do not share it with anyone.
