/// Abstract base class for defining tools that an AI agent can invoke.
///
/// An [AiTool] represents a capability that the AI can use to interact with the
/// external environment or perform specific actions. For example, a tool could
/// allow the AI to save a file, query a database, or call an external API.
///
/// Concrete tool implementations must extend this class and provide:
/// - A unique [name] for the tool.
/// - A [description] of what the tool does, which helps the AI understand when
///   to use it.
/// - Optionally, a [parameters] schema defining the arguments the tool expects.
/// - An implementation of the [invoke] method to execute the tool's logic.
///
/// The generic argument determines the return type of [invoke], and must extend
/// a `Json` because that's what is required by the Gemini tool
/// calling API.
abstract class AiTool<T extends JsonMap> {
  /// Creates an instance of [AiTool].
  ///
  /// - [name]: A unique identifier for the tool. This name is used by the AI to
  ///   specify which tool to call.
  /// - [description]: A natural language description of the tool's purpose and
  ///   functionality. This helps the AI decide when and how to use the tool.
  /// - [parameters]: An optional [Schema] that defines the structure and types
  ///   of arguments the tool accepts. If the tool requires no arguments, this
  ///   can be omitted.

  /// "readFile" and a [prefix] of "file" would be registered under both
  /// "readFile" and "file.readFile".
  ///
  /// This is so that the AI can ask for the "readFile" tool, even if it was
